# Learning-how-to-learn
## Me and my problems
My name is Rajat Kumar Panda. I love learning about how things work, how the world works and especially how humans work.
I have problems focusing on things or at least that's what I believed. I struggled to sit at one place and do things for a long time. And all this led me to believe that I can't learn. But after taking this course I realized that this is not the case.

The best way to master anything in life is to either ask a lot of questions about a topic or join a group where people are asking a lot of questions. But finding the answers to all those questions requires one to spend a lot of time and takes a lot of patience.

## What I knew about learning.
One thing that I already knew about learning before joining the course, it was about the power of writing.

-> After watching jordan peterson's video about why we should write I understood a few things:-
1. By writing without looking at the text or the video again we become good at remembering things. It's very important for us to remember what we have learnt so that we can implement it at the right place.
2. By writing we get clarity about the text and leads to realization of what we know and what we don't.

-> First step is the most difficult one. One who has realized the power of the first step can achieve anything. If the person has successfully taken the first step towards their goal, certainly they will be able to take the last one.

## What I learnt from the course:
### About myself
After taking this course I realized that we all are capable of learning. We must invest the time and effort that is required as it is a necessity for our survival.
I focused a lot of my time on the end product and did not do the required process in order to achieve that product. I was so engrossed into thinking about the product that I never took the first step. I was scared.

### Illusion of passion
Passion is a unicorn that does not exist. We must not look for what we like or what we would like to learn about, rather spend time doing or learning that is in front of us.
Initially when we try to do something new or learn anything new, it's painful, physically, even if it is not a physical task. We must not be afraid of taking the first step towards our goal. Once we take the first step, our brain will automatically find ways to get something done or find ways to learn the things that we are trying to learn.

### Happiness and knowledge, the by products
Happiness and knowledge are two things that are byproducts of action and are not the end goal. We must realise that if we focus on the task at hand, learning and happiness will come on their own.
-> Happiness is not the end goal. As it is not a very clear goal. Once we do the  task at hand perfectly our brain will reward us, which will translate to happiness.
-> We must spend time reading, memorizing and recalling which will help us gain knowledge. We must not think and worry about knowledge as we gain it automatically by doing the above three things.

### Pomodoro
Pomodoro in italian means tomato. It's a very important tool. It gives you a process to focus on. We just have to do the required thing for 25 minutes without worrying too much about the end goals. It helps us focus on the things in front of us. At the end we take a break of 5 minutes or 15 minutes.

### Take rest
Rest is a very crucial part of learning. It helps us get into the diffused mode of learning, as this mode helps us to connect the dots in our brain that we never knew were possible to connect. Things like taking a walk, running or just breathing which can be done on autopilot help the brain unwind.

### Memorization and visualization
Remembering things is crucial too. We must remember exactly how things work or how things are done. I struggle with remembering things. The way that helps me the most is to draw the connections between the keywords before writing about the things, which acts as a visual clue and helps me in remembering things easily.

### Maths
When we say cow, an image of a cow is formed in our brain. But that is not the case with maths. Maths is a little difficult because we don't have something that resembles '+' and '-' in nature. We must practice a lot of questions before we start to observe the pattern in nature. Only after a lot of practice we will be able to visualize mathematics. A good example of this is the fibonacci series. Fibonacci pattern is the most efficient way nature stores the seeds in the plant. You will only be able to see that pattern in nature when you have understood and practiced a lot of fibonacci related problems.

### Learning about various fields of science
As an engineer it's my job to create solutions. By learning about other engineering fields, I can learn new ways to come up with innovative solutions. The interleaving of knowledge of various fields will help me create better and more efficient solutions.

## Thank you
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for coming up with this course and helping so many students world wide and the bonus interview videos. I was really inspired by  the interview with Mr. Scott Young and his passion for learning.

I would also like to thank the peers who took the time to review this article.
